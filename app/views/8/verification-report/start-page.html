            <p class="govuk-body-l">A verification report is a new kind of

              research task.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a verification report?</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">When someone meets the criteria for a
              verification report, you will:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>request domestic violence checks from the police</li>
              <li>request child safeguarding checks from social services</li>
              <li>interview the defendant before their first hearing</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">Using the information from the police checks
              and interview, you can assess someone's suitability for either
              electronic monitoring curfew, unpaid work or both.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can deliver this information to the court
              in a defendant's plea hearing. The court will not need to adjourn
              for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are the criteria for a verification
              report?</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">Someone can be considered for a verification
              report if:</p>
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>their most serious offence is in scope for a community order
                  but not severe enough for a custodial sentence</li>
                <li>they have entered a guilty anticipated plea</li>
                <li>they have no specific risk flags in NDelius </li>
                <li>there are no case markers in Common Platform</li>
                <li>they are at liberty on the day of their plea hearing</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">Defendants from black and ethnic minority
              backgrounds, female defendants and those aged between 18 to 25
              years old are not eligible for verification reports. They must
              receive a full pre-sentence report.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">There are also times when a sentencer may
              request a verification report either before or after a plea
              hearing, or after a trial. A probation officer may also assess
              someone for a pre-sentence report and decide that they are more
              suitable for a verification report.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">This service will identify cases which meet
              these criteria automatically. You must confirm if it has
              identified cases correctly, and identified all eligible cases by
              confirming each defendant's suitability for either a verification
              report, a pre-sentence report or no advice.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to use this service</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">You can complete this form in any order,
              over a period of time. </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">You should add information as you get it. We
